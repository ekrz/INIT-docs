This blog post will detail the wished roadmap for INIT. INIT is an ambitious project that will grow as time pass. Each project you start with INIT will provide feedback that will need to be implemented as soon as possible in order to get a finished product that answers to all the needs.

## Steps

1. Create another release init-lite
2. Create base components (footer, header, banner, carousel)
3. Clarify documentation

## Init Lite

This version will contain the most basic settings of INIT, and get rid of the most advanced configuration.

## On font icons

We decided to remove icons to privilege the use of SVG.
Therefore the fontello-integration won't be included in the lite version of INIT.
